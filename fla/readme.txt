qb2VisualEditorLibrary.fla contains a library of assets extending from various qb2Proxy subclasses.  You can use these assets to create physics objects graphically which can then be brought into your game through qb2FlashLoader.

You should either copy and paste this .fla, copy and paste all its assets, or use this .fla as a template, but you shouldn't use this .fla directly.

Check in the examples folder to see how the whole system works with some other .flas.
