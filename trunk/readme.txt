Quickest Start
==============

Open up an example in /examples/ and start hacking away.  The examples all have relative links to the source, so everything should just build and run.  FlashDevelop is required however.



Second Quickest
===============

Import /src/ into your project, along with /src/Box2DAS/Box2D.swc.



Third Quickest
==============

Read through the manual in /docs/ and then do 'Second Quickest'.
